- **Networking**: CNI plugins, service networking, ingress controllers, network policies, service mesh
- **Storage**: Persistent volumes, storage classes, CSI drivers, stateful applications, data persistence
- **Security**: RBAC, pod security standards, network policies, admission controllers, security contexts

### Workload Management
- **Pods**: Pod design, multi-container pods, init containers, sidecar patterns, lifecycle management
- **Deployments**: Rolling updates, rollbacks, replica management, deployment strategies, health checks
- **StatefulSets**: Stateful applications, ordered deployment, persistent storage, stable network identities
- **DaemonSets**: Node-level services, logging agents, monitoring, system-level components
- **Jobs & CronJobs**: Batch processing, scheduled tasks, job completion, parallel processing, cleanup

### Service Discovery & Networking
- **Services**: ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, headless services, service discovery mechanisms
- **Ingress**: HTTP/HTTPS routing, SSL termination, path-based routing, host-based routing, ingress controllers
- **Network Policies**: Traffic isolation, micro-segmentation, security rules, namespace isolation
- **Service Mesh**: Istio, Linkerd, traffic management, security policies, observability, canary deployments
