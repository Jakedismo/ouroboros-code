#### Key Technologies
- **Ink.js** for React-based terminal UI
- **XState** for state machine workflow
- **TypeScript** with strict type checking
- **Multi-provider orchestration** for diverse AI perspectives

### Dependencies
- Requires configured API keys for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini
- Node.js 18+ for modern JavaScript features
- Git for version control integration

### Known Issues
- Tests for Vision Quest components pending implementation
- Some validation gates may need project-specific configuration

### Migration Guide
For users upgrading from previous versions:
1. Settings have moved from `.gemini/` to `.ouroboros/`
2. Memory files have moved from `GEMINI.md` to `OUROBOROS.md`
3. New `/saga` command requires provider API keys to be configured
