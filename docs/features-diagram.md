# Features Diagram

This page links to two complementary views of the Ouroboros Code feature map:

- Interactive HTML: [docs/features-diagram.html](./features-diagram.html)
- Static SVG (print/export friendly): [docs/assets/features-diagram.svg](./assets/features-diagram.svg)

Tips for the interactive version:
- Scroll to zoom, Shift+drag to pan.
- Click a node to see details and links to relevant documentation in the right pane.
- Use the checkboxes on the left to filter categories (Agents, Tools, Providers, etc.).
- Use the search box to quickly highlight matching nodes and connections.

If you want additional nodes, colors, or cross-links added to the diagram, let us know which items to include and we’ll update both HTML and SVG sources accordingly.
